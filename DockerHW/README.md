- **Instructions & Steps:**  
  1. **Dockerfile Creation:**

  2. **Docker Compose Setup:**  
     - Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to define and run the container.
  3. **Local Verification:**  
     - Run `docker-compose up` in the `DockerHW` directory to verify that the container is created successfully.
